# Adwaita-Folder-Icons
Additional folder icons for GNOME

![preview](https://github.com/daudix-UFO/Adwaita-Folder-Icons/raw/main/preview.png)

## What and why?

This is additional Adwaita folder icons that can be used for folders to make them more distinguishable, this is not an icon theme, this is the exact same Adwaita icons but with different symbolics. size and position are 1:1 to Adwaita folders

Icons used are either from [adwaita-icon-theme](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme) or [icon-development-kit](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/icon-development-kit). To browse icons from both, use [Icon Library](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/design/icon-library)

There are some silly icons, don't take them seriously ;)

## Why not [SIMILAR PROJECT NAME]?

Because most of them do it wrong, they have wrong icon scale and alignment, and these that [done it right](https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/Custom-Adwaita-Folder-Icons) are not updated to "GNOME 44 one svg icon"

## Request new icons

If you would like to see a new icon, please open an issue and describe what icon you would like to see, preferably with a use-case
